## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: 
#### get and post request from the Airtable Api

### Weaknesses:
#### I struggle in certain parts of the Reactjs such as props because i get confused sometimes like where to pass.
### Opportunities:
#### This project will help me better my learned skills, and strengthen my current weaknesses.

### Threats:
#### Not good at components.
