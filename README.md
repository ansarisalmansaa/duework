## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: 
get and post request from the Airtable Api

### Weaknesses:
I struggle in certain parts of the Reactjs such as props because i get confused sometimes like where to pass.
### Opportunities:
This project will help me better my learned skills, and strengthen my current weaknesses.

### Threats:
Not good at components.
